(setf (documentation 'standard/context 'method-combination)
      "A method combination which extends the standard method combination with support `:context` qualifiers. Context methods are executed before around methods, and in least-specificâ€“first order.

Context methods are intended to set up a dynamic context that all specializations for subclasses can take for granted.

In many cases context methods can simplify implementation by avoiding the need to have a separate, internal wrapper function for a generic function exposed for extension.")
