;;; `defparameter' and `defconstant', respectively).

(defmacro def (var &body (&optional val documentation))
  "The famous \"deflex\".

Define a top level (global) lexical VAR with initial value VAL,
which is assigned unconditionally as with DEFPARAMETER. If a DOC
string is provided, it is attached to both the name |VAR| and the name
*STORAGE-FOR-DEFLEX-VAR-|VAR|* as a documentation string of kind
'VARIABLE. The new VAR will have lexical scope and thus may be
shadowed by LET bindings without affecting its dynamic (global) value.

The original `deflex' is due to Rob Warnock.

This version of `deflex' differs from the original in the following ways:

- It is possible for VAL to close over VAR.
- On implementations that support it (SBCL, CCL, and LispWorks, at the
moment) this version creates a backing variable that is \"global\" or
\"static\", so there is not just a change in semantics, but also a
gain in efficiency.
- If VAR is a list that starts with `values`, each element is treated as
a separate variable and initialized as if by `(setf (values VAR...)
VAL)`."
