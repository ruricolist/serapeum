  "Easily define a defstruct with no mutable slots.

The syntax of `defstruct-read-only' is as close as possible to that of
`defstruct'. Given an existing structure definition, you can usually
make it immutable simply by switching out `defstruct' for
`defstruct-read-only'.

There are only a few syntactic differences:

1. To prevent accidentally inheriting mutable slots, and preserve its
   own usefulness as a marker of the programmer's intent,
   `defstruct-read-only' only allows inheritance from other classes
   defined using `defstruct-read-only'.

2. The `:type' option may not be used.

3. The `:copier' option is disabled, because it would be useless.

4. Slot definitions can use slot options without having to provide an
   initform. In this case, any attempt to make an instance of the
   struct without providing a value for that slot will signal an
   error.

    (my-slot :type string)
    â‰¡ (my-slot (required-argument 'my-slot) :read-only t :type string)

The idea here is simply that an unbound slot in an immutable data
structure does not make sense.

A read-only struct is always externalizable; it has an implicit
definition for `make-load-form'.

On Lisps that support it, the structure is also marked as \"pure\":
that is, instances may be moved into read-only memory.

`defstruct-read-only' is designed to stay as close to the syntax of
`defstruct' as possible. The idea is to make it easy to flag data as
immutable, whether in your own code or in code you are refactoring. In
new code, however, you may sometimes prefer `defconstructor', which is
designed to facilitate working with immutable data."

                          &environment env)
  "A variant of `defstruct' for modeling immutable data.

The structure defined by `defconstructor' has only one constructor,
which takes its arguments as required arguments (a BOA constructor).
Thus, `defconstructor' is only appropriate for data structures that
require no initialization.

The printed representation of an instance resembles its constructor:

    (person \"Common Lisp\" 33)
    => (PERSON \"Common Lisp\" 33)

While the constructor is BOA, the copier takes keyword arguments,
allowing you to override the values of a selection of the slots of the
structure being copied, while retaining the values of the others.

    (defconstructor person
      (name string)
      (age (integer 0 1000)))

    (defun birthday (person)
      (copy-person person :age (1+ (person-age person))))

    (birthday (person \"Common Lisp\" 33))
    => (PERSON \"Common Lisp\" 34)

Obviously the copier becomes more useful the more slots the type has.

When `*print-readably*' is true, the printed representation is
readable:

    (person \"Common Lisp\" 33)
    => #.(PERSON \"Common Lisp\" 33)

\(Why override how a structure is normally printed? Structure types
are not necessarily readable unless they have a default \(`make-X')
constructor. Since the type defined by `defconstructor' has only one
constructor, we have to take over to make sure it re-readable.)

Besides being re-readable, the type is also externalizable, with a
method for `make-load-form':

    (make-load-form (person \"Common Lisp\" 33))
    => (PERSON \"Common Lisp\" 33)

Users of Trivia get an extra benefit: defining a type with
`defconstructor' also defines a symmetrical pattern for destructuring
that type.

    (trivia:match (person \"Common Lisp\" 33)
      ((person name age)
       (list name age)))
    => (\"Common Lisp\" 33)

Note that the arguments to the pattern are optional:

    (trivia:match (person \"Common Lisp\" 33)
      ((person name) name))
    => \"Common Lisp\"

If you don't use Trivia, you can still do destructuring with
`deconstruct', which returns the slots of a constructor as multiple
values:

    (deconstruct (person \"Common Lisp\" 33))
    => \"Common Lisp\", 33

Note also that no predicate is defined for the type, so to test for
the type you must either use `typep' or pattern matching as above.

While it is possible to inherit from a type defined with
`defconstructor' (this is Lisp, I can't stop you), it's a bad idea. In
particular, on Lisps which support it, a type defined with
`defconstructor' is declared to be frozen (sealed), so your new
subtype may not be recognized in type tests that have already been
compiled.

Because `defconstructor' is implemented on top of
`defstruct-read-only', it shares the limitations of
`defstruct-read-only'. In particular it cannot use inheritance.

The design of `defconstructor' is mostly inspired by Scala's [case
classes](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html), with
some implementation tricks from `cl-algebraic-data-type'."
