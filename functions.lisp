  "Define a higher-order function and its compiler macro at once.

When defining a higher-order function it is often a good idea to
write a compiler macro so compilers can inline the resulting lambda
form.

For the special case of a fixed-arity function that only takes other
functions as arguments, you can use `define-train' to define the
function and the compiler macro in one go. The catch is that you have
to write the single definition as a macro.

E.g., if `complement' did not exist, you could define it like so:

    (define-train complement (fn)
      `(lambda (&rest args)
         (not (apply ,fn args))))

Besides providing an implicit compiler macro, `define-train' also
inserts the proper declarations to ensure the compiler recognizes the
function arguments as functions, avoiding runtime type checks.

Some ancient Lisps had closures without lexical binding. Instead, you

the resulting closure was called, the symbols closed over would be
bound to their storage at the time the closure was created. These
bindings would persist through subsequent invocations and could be
mutated. The result was something between a closure and a
continuation.

This particular piece of Lisp history is worth reviving, I think, if
only for use with threads. For example, to start a thread and
propagate the current value of `*standard-output*':
