  "A macro-writing macro for the `call-with-' style.

In the `call-with-' style of writing macros, the macro is simply a
syntactic convenience that wraps its body in a thunk and a call to the
function that does the actual work.

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      `(call-with-foo (lambda () ,@body)))

The `call-with-' style has many advantages. Functions are easier to
write than macros; you can change the behavior of a function without
having to recompile all its callers; functions can be traced, appear
in backtraces, etc.

But meanwhile, all those thunks are being allocated on the heap. Can
we avoid this? Yes, but at a high cost in boilerplate: the closure has
to be given a name (using `flet') so it can be declared
`dynamic-extent'.

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)

        `(flet ((,thunk () ,@body))

`with-thunk' avoids the boilerplate:

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      (with-thunk (body)
        `(call-with-foo ,body)))

It is also possible to construct a \"thunk\" with arguments.

    (with-thunk (body foo)
      `(call-with-foo ,body))
    â‰¡ `(flet ((,thunk (,foo)
          ,@body))

  "Define an iteration macro like `dolist'.

Writing a macro like `dolist' is more complicated than it looks. For
consistency with the rest of CL, you have to do all of the following:

- The entire loop must be surrounded with an implicit `nil' block.
- The body of the loop must be an implicit `tagbody'.
- There must be an optional `return' form which, if given, supplies
  the values to return from the loop.
- While this return form is being evaluated, the iteration variables
  must be bound to `nil'.

Say you wanted to define a `do-hash' macro that iterates over hash
tables. A full implementation would look like this:

     (defmacro do-hash ((key value hash-table &optional return) &body body)
       (multiple-value-bind (body decls) (parse-body body)
         `(block nil

(defmacro define-case-macro (name macro-args params &body macro-body)
  "Define a macro like `case'.

A case-like macro is one that supports the following syntax:

- A list of keys is treated as matching any key in the list.
- An empty list matches nothing.
- The atoms T or `otherwise' introduce a default clause.
- There can only be one default clause.
- The default clause must come last.
- Any atom besides the empty list, T, or `otherwise' matches itself.

As a consequence of the above, to match against the empty list, T, or
`otherwise', they must be wrapped in a list.

    (case x
      ((nil) \"Matched nil.\")
      ((t) \"Matched t.\")
      ((otherwise) \"Matched `otherwise'.\")
      (otherwise \"Didn't match anything.\"))

A macro defined using `define-case-macro' can ignore all of the above.
It receives three arguments: the expression, already protected against
multiple evaluation; a normalized list of clauses; and, optionally, a
default clause.

The clauses are normalized as a list of `(key . body)', where each key
is an atom. (That includes nil, T, and `otherwise'.) Nonetheless, each
body passed to the macro will only appear once in the expansion; there
will be no duplicated code.

The body of the default clause is passed separately,
bound to the value of the `:default' keyword in PARAMS.

    (define-case-macro my-case (expr &body clauses)
        (:default default)
      ....)

Note that in this case, `default' will be bound to the clause's body
-- a list of forms -- and not to the whole clause. The key of the
default clause is discarded.

If no binding is specified for the default clause, then no default
clause is allowed.

One thing you do still have to consider is the handling of duplicated
keys. The macro defined by `define-case-macro' will reject case sets
that contains duplicate keys under `eql', but depending on the
semantics of your macro, you may need to check for duplicates under a
looser definition of equality.

As a final example, if the `case' macro did not already exist, you
could define it almost trivially using `define-case-macro':

    (define-case-macro my-case (expr &body clause)
        (:default default)
      `(cond
         ,@(loop for (key . body) in clauses
