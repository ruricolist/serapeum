  "`mapply' is a cousin of `mapcar'.

If you think of `mapcar' as using `funcall':

    (mapcar #'- '(1 2 3))
    ≅ (loop for item in '(1 2 3)
            collect (funcall #'- item))

Then `mapply' does the same thing, but with `apply' instead.

    (loop for item in '((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
            collect (apply #'+ item))
    => (6 15)

    (mapply #'+ '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
    => (6 15)

In variadic use, `mapply' acts as if `append' had first been used:

    (mapply #'+ xs ys)
    ≡ (mapply #'+ (mapcar #'append xs ys))

But the actual implementation is more efficient.

`mapply' can convert a list of two-element lists into an alist:

    (mapply #'cons '((x 1) (y 2))
    => '((x . 1) (y . 2))"
