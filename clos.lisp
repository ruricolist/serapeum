(defmacro defmethods (class (self . slots) &body body)
  "Concisely define methods that specialize on the same class.

You can already use `defgeneric' to define an arbitrary number of
methods on a single generic function without having to repeat the name
of the function:

    (defgeneric fn (x)
      (:method ((x string)) ...)
      (:method ((x number)) ...))

Which is equivalent to:

    (defgeneric fn (x))

    (defmethod fn ((x string))
      ...)

    (defmethod fn ((x number))
      ...)

Similarly, you can use `defmethods' to define methods that specialize
on the same class, and access the same slots, without having to
repeat the names of the class or the slots:

    (defmethods my-class (self x y)
      (:method initialize-instance :after (self &key)
        ...)
      (:method print-object (self stream)
        ...)
      (:method some-method ((x string) self)
        ...))

Which is equivalent to:

    (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self my-class) &key)
      (with-slots (x y) self
        ...))

    (defmethod print-object ((self my-class) stream)
      (with-slots (x y) self
        ...))

    (defmethod some-method ((x string) (self my-class))
      (with-slots (y) self              ;!
        ...))

Note in particular that `self' can appear in any position, and that
you can freely specialize the other arguments.

Just as in `with-slots', slots can be renamed:

    (defmethods my-class (self (abscissa x) (ordinate y))
      ...)

You can also use `defmethods' in place of `with-accessors', by using a
function-quote:

    (defmethods my-class (self (x #'my-class-x)
                               (y #'my-class-y))
      ...)

\(The difference from using `with-slots' is the scope of the slot
bindings: they are established *outside* of the method definition,
which means argument bindings shadow slot bindings:

    (some-method \"foo\" (make 'my-class :x \"bar\"))
    => \"foo\"

Since slot bindings are lexically outside the argument bindings, this
is surely correct, even if it makes `defmethods' slightly harder to
explain in terms of simpler constructs.)

Is `defmethods' trivial? Yes, in terms of its implementation. This
docstring is far longer than the code it documents. But you may find
it does a lot to keep heavily object-oriented code readable and
organized, without any loss of power.

Note that `defmethods' may also be useful when converting state
machines written using `labels' into an object-oriented style.

This construct is very loosely inspired by impl blocks in Rust."
