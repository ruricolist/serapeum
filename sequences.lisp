Groups are ordered as encountered. This property means you could, in
principle, use `assort' to implement `remove-duplicates' by taking the
first element of each group:

     (mapcar #'first (assort list))
     ≡ (remove-duplicates list :from-end t)

However, if TEST is ambiguous (a partial order), and an element could
qualify as a member of more than one group, then it is not guaranteed
that it will end up in the leftmost group that it could be a member
of.

    (assort '(1 2 1 2 1 2) :test #'<=)
    => '((1 1) (2 2 1 2))

The default algorithm used by `assort' is, in the worst case, O(n) in
the number of groups. If HASH is specified, then a hash table is used
instead. However TEST must be acceptable as the `:test' argument to
`make-hash-table'."

  "Like `reduce' extended to multiple values.

Calling `mvfold' with one seed is equivalent to `reduce':

    (mvfold fn xs seed) ≡ (reduce fn xs :initial-value seed)

However, you can also call `mvfold' with multiple seeds:

    (mvfold fn xs seed1 seed2 seed3 ...)

How is this useful? Consider extracting the minimum of a sequence:

    (reduce #'min xs)

Or the maximum:

    (reduce #'max xs)

But both?

    (reduce (lambda (cons item)
              (cons (min (car cons) item)
                    (max (cdr cons) item)))
            xs
            :initial-value (cons (elt xs 0) (elt xs 0)))

You can do this naturally with `mvfold'.

    (mvfold (lambda (min max item)
              (values (min item min)
                      (max item max)))
            xs (elt xs 0) (elt xs 0))

In general `mvfold' provides a functional idiom for “loops with
book-keeping” where we might otherwise have to use recursion or
explicit iteration.
