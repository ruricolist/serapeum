  "A macro for writing fast sequence functions (among other things).

In the simplest case, this macro produces one copy of BODY for each
type in TYPES, with the appropriate declarations to induce your Lisp
to optimize that version of BODY for the appropriate type.

Say VAR is a string. With this macro, you can trivially emit optimized
code for the different kinds of string that VAR might be. And
then (ideally) instead of getting code that dispatches on the type of
VAR every time you call `aref', you get code that dispatches on the
type of VAR once, and then uses the appropriately specialized
accessors. (But see `with-string-dispatch'.)

But that's the simplest case. Using `with-type-dispatch' also provides
*transparent portability*. It examines TYPES to deduplicate types that
are not distinct on the current Lisp, or that are shadowed by other
provided types. And the expansion strategy may differ from Lisp to
Lisp: ideally, you should not have to pay for good performance on
Lisps with type inference with pointless code bloat on other Lisps.

There is an additional benefit for vector types. Around each version
of BODY, the definition of `vref' is shadowed to expand into an
appropriate accessor. E.g., within a version of BODY where VAR is
known to be a `simple-string', `vref' expands into `schar'.

Using `vref' instead of `aref' is obviously useful on Lisps that do
not do type inference, but even on Lisps with type inference it can
speed compilation times (compiling `aref' is relatively slow on SBCL).

Within `with-type-dispatch', VAR should be regarded as read-only.

Note that `with-type-dispatch' is intended to be used around
relatively expensive code, particularly loops. For simpler code, the
gains from specialized compilation may not justify the overhead of the
initial dispatch and the increased code size.

Note also that `with-type-dispatch' is relatively low level. You may
want to use one of the other macros in the same family, such as
`with-subtype-dispatch', `with-string-dispatch', or so forth.

The design and implementation of `with-type-dispatch' is based on a
few sources. It replaces a similar macro formerly included in
Serapeum, `with-templated-body'. One possible expansion is based on
the `string-dispatch' macro used internally in SBCL. But most of the
credit should go to the paper \"Fast, Maintable, and Portable Sequence
Functions\", by Irène Durand and Robert Strandh."
